## Code Tech Task 1
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project explores various characteristics of the data, including distributions, correlations, and relationships between features. It also visualizes the data to gain insights into patterns and potential outliers.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:
- Analyze and understand the structure of the Iris dataset.
- Perform univariate and multivariate analysis to explore feature distributions and relationships.
- Identify correlations and visualize them using heatmaps.
- Detect potential outliers through visualization techniques.
- Summarize key insights from the data exploration process.

## Key Activities

1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration:**  
   - Loading the Iris dataset using `seaborn` and performing basic summary statistics.

2. **Univariate Analysis:**  
   - Plotting histograms and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots to understand the distribution of individual features.

3. **Multivariate Analysis:**  
   - Using scatter plots and pair plots to analyze relationships between features.

4. **Correlation and Heatmap:**  
   - Calculating correlations between numerical features and visualizing them using a heatmap.

5. **Outlier Detection:**  
   - Utilizing box plots and violin plots to identify potential outliers within the dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations and statistical operations.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization through various charts and plots.
- **Seaborn:** For generating high-level visualizations, including pair plots and heatmaps.

## Key Insights

- The EDA process revealed that the Iris dataset has well-separated clusters for different species, as seen in the pair plots.
- Correlation analysis showed strong relationships between petal length and petal width, while sepal length and sepal width had weaker correlations.
- Visualizations, including scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps, highlighted the key patterns, helping identify potential areas for further analysis.
- Outlier detection through box plots and violin plots provided insights into data points that may require special attention during modeling.
